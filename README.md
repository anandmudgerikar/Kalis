### TO-DOs ###

Immediate items to do:
* Remove need for full package name in initial config file and simply add that string in front when you are about to use Reflection to load the module class.
* PacketFactory.getPacket(String[] raw) does not call any Packet constructor! (And actually would always generate an error at the moment...).
* The DataStore.onNewPacket() methods have a lot of duplicated code!
* The DataStore.onNewPacket() methods should not care if the packet is coming from a trace or from a live stream... why do we have that parameter? And why is the timestamp set there?
* The DataStore.onNewPacket() method for CSV packets also logs to a CSV file, which does not make sense.
* Time correctly the notification of packets when replaying a trace.
* In the Main, the "tracefile" must be specifiable by command line arguments.

* Switch from the "Listen" thing to the PrintF primitive in TinyOS to send text over serial to the listening Java application. We need to send data from the application layer (when receiving generic non-CTP packets) and from inside CtpForwardingEngine (when receiving CTP packets).
* After the switch to PrintF, the getPacket() functions in PacketFactory should be merged.
* Implement a SelectiveForwarding module.

Next iteration:
* Have each module expose its characteristics statically (for now, e.g., "IsForMultihop" and "IsForSinglehop" could be static bool properties). The KnowledgeBase component then should be able to iterate over all modules in the edu.purdue.idsforiot.modules package and select only those that have the right characteristics for the current environment.
