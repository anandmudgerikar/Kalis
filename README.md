# KALIS IDS

Kalis is a self-adapting,knowledge-driven expert Intrusion Detection System able to detect attacks in real time across a wide range of IoT systems.

The prototype has been tested on a network of telosb sensors and IoT devices running TinyOS. The framework should function for all environments as long as corresponding sensing and detection modules are present. The data/ directory contains replays of network attacks mentioned in the paper to play around with.
